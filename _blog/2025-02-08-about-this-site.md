Welcome to the most unique, innovative, and utterly feline-dominated cat-selling website in existence. Unlike ordinary pet adoption sites, this one isn’t run by humans – oh no. This site is owned and managed by the cats themselves, with a humble human acting as their obedient web developer. Every design choice, pricing strategy, and marketing decision is dictated by a secret feline council, ensuring that only the finest, most regal, and occasionally mischievous cats make it to the listings.

The mastermind behind the code? A guy who once believed he was in control. Little did he know, he was merely a vessel through which the cats exerted their will. They sit on his keyboard, walk across his touchpad, and occasionally knock over his coffee just to remind him who’s really in charge. Through a series of well-timed meows, head nudges, and menacing stares, they ensure that every line of code aligns with their ultimate goal: world domination—one cat adoption at a time.

Each cat on this site has a story. There’s Romesh, the brave and silky-haired leader, who personally oversees customer service. Granite Unni, a rare and elegant tortoiseshell, manages quality control—ensuring that only the best nap spots are approved. President, the fierce yet gentlemanly feline, runs security, keeping an eye out for shady transactions and unauthorized belly rubs. And then there’s Bad Unni, the troublemaker who ensures that at least one part of the website remains broken at all times, just to keep the human developer on edge.

If you’re looking for a cat, this is the place to be. Not only will you find a feline companion, but you’ll also be supporting the grand vision of a world where humans serve their true purpose—catering to the whims of their feline overlords. So, browse the listings, find your perfect match, and prepare to surrender your home, heart, and possibly your furniture to your new cat boss.
